Toy Problem Challenges
Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade, as follows:

A > 79
B - 60 to 79
C - 59 to 49
D - 40 to 49
E - less than 40
How to Use
Install Dependencies: Before running the Student Grade Generator, make sure to install the prompt-sync library. If you don't have it installed, you can do so using the following command:

npm install prompt-sync
Run the Program: After installing the dependency, you can run the program using your preferred JavaScript environment. For example, in Node.js:

node studentGradeGenerator.js
Challenge 2: Speed Detector
Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input (e.g., 80). If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: "Points: 2". If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended".

How to Use
Run the Program:

node speedDetector.js
